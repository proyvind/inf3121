Congratulations for a very good effort and a good delivery. 
You have obtained 24 points:

4/5 p: Req. 1 The non-functional part needs to be approached just as concretely as the functional part, for both the analysis and test cases (lecture 2). The non-functional part needs to be approached just as concretely as the functional part, for both the analysis and test cases (I appreciated the fact you have mentioned part of the non-functinonal aspects. I agree load and stress do not make sense. However, there are a lot of other non-functional aspects that can be checked like all the usability aspects for user interface, installability, maintenance, etc). The manual tests look good.
10/10 p: Req. 2 Very good.
10/10 p: Req. 3 Very good.
